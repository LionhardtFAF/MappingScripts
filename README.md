# MappingScripts

In this repository I will add the odd script I write to help with map making. Go to the respective sub-folder for the inidivudal scripts. 

You can find scripts for the following tasks:

* Cloud Leveling: Adjust height of all clouds on a map to teh same specified value.
* Marker and Unit Transformation: Applies affine transformations to markers and/ or units on a map.
